Fret not , we have a solution.

What's In A Caption is one stop tool to all your caption queries.A chrome extension that analyzes the photos and provide related quotes from Tumblr and Pinterest by using OCR.
It does an object recognition and uses Microsoft's computer Vision API to extrat tags from the photo. Combining the tags , it does a Word Sense Disambiguation to find the context of the tags and objects and hence provides desirable caption.
